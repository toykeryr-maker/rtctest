  **Design Movement**: Cyberpunk / Neon Noir
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **High Contrast & Glow**: Deep blacks contrasted with intense neon colors (cyan, magenta, electric purple) to create a futuristic, server-room vibe.
  2. **Glitch & Distortion**: Subtle glitch effects on hover and transitions to mimic digital signal interference, reinforcing the "tech/server" theme.
  3. **Grid & Structure**: Visible grid lines and modular layouts inspired by circuit boards and server racks.
  4. **Immersive Depth**: Use of layering, parallax scrolling, and blurred background elements to create a sense of 3D space.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: Deep Void Black (#050505) to Midnight Blue (#0a0a1a) - represents the depth of the digital world.
  - **Primary Accent**: Neon Cyan (#00f3ff) - represents data flow and connectivity.
  - **Secondary Accent**: Electric Purple (#bc13fe) - adds a creative, entertainment-focused energy.
  - **Text**: White with subtle outer glow for readability against dark backgrounds.
  - *Reasoning*: This palette directly reflects the "FiveM Server" and "Gaming" culture, which heavily utilizes RGB aesthetics. It evokes excitement and high-tech capability.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric Modular**: Avoid standard centered containers. Use a bento-box style grid that is slightly offset or broken by diagonal lines.
  - **HUD-inspired Navigation**: Navigation elements that look like a Heads-Up Display (HUD) in a game, perhaps fixed to the corners or floating.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Holographic Cards**: Service cards (Website, FiveM, Systems) that look like floating glass panels with a glowing border.
  2. **Digital Noise/Grain**: A subtle film grain overlay to make the digital elements feel more tactile and less sterile.
  3. **Code Snippet Decorations**: Background elements featuring faint, scrolling code or terminal commands.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **"Power On" Effects**: Elements light up or "boot up" when scrolled into view.
  - **Magnetic Buttons**: Buttons that slightly pull towards the cursor, mimicking a magnetic field.
  - **Instant Feedback**: Hover states should be snappy and bright, like flipping a switch.

  **Animation**:
  - **Entrance**: Staggered reveal with a "glitch-in" effect for text and images.
  - **Scroll**: Parallax movement for background grid lines vs. foreground content.
  - **Hover**: Intensity of neon glows increases; text might briefly scramble/decode.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Orbitron** or **Rajdhani** (Geometric, squared-off sans-serif) - screams "Sci-Fi" and "Tech".
  - **Body**: **Exo 2** or **Chakra Petch** - readable but with a technological edge.
  - **Hierarchy**: Massive, glowing headers > Monospaced labels (like system logs) > Clean body text.

  **Design Movement**: Glassmorphism / Frost Tech
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Translucency & Blur**: Heavy use of backdrop-filter: blur() to create frosted glass effects, suggesting modern, premium software.
  2. **Soft Gradients**: Fluid, moving gradients in the background that shift slowly, representing the dynamic nature of the cloud/servers.
  3. **Floating Elements**: Content sits on "floating" layers above the background, creating a sense of lightness and speed.
  4. **Clean & Minimalist**: Stripping away heavy borders and solid containers in favor of light and shadow to define space.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: Dark Grey (#1a1a1a) with moving orbs of Deep Blue (#1e3a8a) and Violet (#5b21b6).
  - **Glass Surface**: White with 5-10% opacity + blur.
  - **Borders**: Thin, semi-transparent white borders (1px) to define edges of glass.
  - **Text**: Pure White for high contrast.
  - *Reasoning*: This approach feels more "Enterprise" and "SaaS" while still keeping the gaming edge through the background colors. It suggests stability and high-end service.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Card-Based Masonry**: Content is organized in cards of varying aspect ratios that fit together like a puzzle.
  - **Central Axis with Floating Satellites**: Main content in the center, with decorative or secondary elements floating around it.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Frosted Glass Cards**: The primary container style.
  2. **Aurora Backgrounds**: Animated mesh gradients that provide a living backdrop.
  3. **3D Icons**: High-quality 3D rendered icons for services (Server, Web, Code) instead of flat vector icons.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Smooth & Fluid**: Transitions are slow and eased (cubic-bezier).
  - **Depth Shift**: Hovering over a card lifts it closer to the user (scale + shadow increase).

  **Animation**:
  - **Float**: Idle animation where elements gently bob up and down.
  - **Glass Shimmer**: A subtle shine effect moves across cards on hover.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Outfit** or **Space Grotesk** - Modern, clean, slightly wide sans-serif.
  - **Body**: **Inter** or **DM Sans** - Highly legible, neutral.
  - **Hierarchy**: Bold, large headings > Medium weight body > Subtle, uppercase tracking-wide labels.

  **Design Movement**: Brutalist / Terminal Retro
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw & Unpolished**: Exposed structural elements, visible layout lines, and a "bare-metal" aesthetic.
  2. **Monospaced Everything**: Using code-editor aesthetics for the entire UI.
  3. **High Contrast Monochrome + 1 Color**: Stark black and white with a single aggressive accent color (e.g., Matrix Green or Error Red).
  4. **Information Density**: Presenting data in a dense, dashboard-like manner rather than spaced-out marketing fluff.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Background**: #000000 (True Black).
  - **Foreground**: #FFFFFF (True White).
  - **Accent**: #00FF41 (Terminal Green) or #FF3333 (Alert Red).
  - *Reasoning*: This appeals to the "developer" and "admin" persona. It says "we know code, we don't hide behind pretty graphics."

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Strict Grid**: Visible 1px borders separating every section.
  - **Split Screen**: Vertical or horizontal dividers that can be dragged or resized (interactive).

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Marquee Text**: Scrolling text banners for announcements.
  2. **ASCII Art**: Using text characters to create visuals.
  3. **Cursor Effects**: Custom block cursor or trailing characters.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Mechanical**: Buttons have no fade; they invert color instantly on hover.
  - **Keyboard First**: Navigation hints for keyboard shortcuts.

  **Animation**:
  - **Typewriter**: Text appears character by character.
  - **Blink**: Cursor and specific indicators blink at a steady rate.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Primary**: **JetBrains Mono** or **Fira Code** - Pure monospaced fonts.
  - **Hierarchy**: Size and weight (Bold vs Regular) are the only differentiators. Uppercase for headers.
